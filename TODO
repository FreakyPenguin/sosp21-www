      - if we are all happy with the newly proposed logo, then
        it could go top left above SIGOPS and USENIX? And you
        could make a version to use as favicon in URL bar?
      - should put a sentence at the bottom to indicate contact
        information for the sponsorship co-chairs?
      - should add the "call for sponsors" blurb on this page
        (I think Tim made and sent one earlier?)
      - for venue page, people can click through to get Google's
        directions, but I would also like to provide the human
        directions that I sent you a while back. Perhaps these
        can be made into a one-pager or a printable PDF so that
	people can have those too. But only if they are correct!
