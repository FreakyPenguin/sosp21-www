The focus of the Systems and Networking Group is the design, implementation, 
analysis, and evaluation of computer systems and networks that knit together 
disparate underlying components to present a cohesive operating environment for 
task-specific applications.

Our members study systems ranging from single-processor, standalone embedded 
systems to large-scale highly-networked distributed systems.  Research activity 
similarly covers a broad variety of topics: parallel hardware, systems 
software, data-centre networking and data-centre systems, wireless networks, 
energy systems, and wide-area networks.

We use many approaches in our work, reflecting our varied expertise.  This 
includes workload characterization, architectural design, algorithm design, 
theoretical analysis, simulation, and the design, implementation and 
experimental evaluation of prototype systems.
