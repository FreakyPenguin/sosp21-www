Child care spaces are available on a first-come-first-serve basis. We have 
currently budgeted for 20 children, but can grow or shrink the number of spots 
based on demand. If you are planning to use the child care service, or have any 
questions about it, please send an email to Carey Williamson (General Co-Chair) 
on or before September 1. The deadline to register for child care is September 
30, 2019.
