	<h3>Call For Student Scholarship Applications</h3>

	<p>
	SOSP 2019, through generous donations from conference sponsors, will 
	offer scholarships to assist students attending the conference. Each 
	scholarship (fully or partially) reimburses the SOSP conference 
	registration, a shared hotel room during the conference, and round trip 
	air travel to/from the conference. scholarship students may be asked to 
	scribe a technical session. These services are greatly appreciated, and 
	provide additional networking opportunities with other conference 
	participants. Actual duties will be assigned as the conference nears, 
	but students should identify any time constraints in their application 
	forms.
	</p>

	<p>
	These funds are limited, and will be based on a combination of need and 
	merit. Scholarship recipient contact information will be made available 
	to scholarship sponsoring organizations.
	</p>

	<h5>Who Should Apply?</h5>
	<p>
	Funding is available to students (graduate and undergraduate) from any 
	educational institution in the world. We especially encourage 
	applications from women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, 
	and all other groups underrepresented in at SOSP, who will be given 
	additional consideration in the scholarship evaluation process. We also 
	recommend them to attend the Diversity Workshop at SOSP (details to 
	come). The workshop may have  additional scholarship funding, and 
	applicants will be evaluated and awards determined through this unified 
	scholarship application process.
