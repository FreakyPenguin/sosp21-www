      <h3>Call for Workshops</h3>

      <h5 class="left-h">Hosting a Workshop</h5>
      <p>
      SOSP 2019 will officially host workshops at the conference venue on  
      Sunday, October 27th. The purpose of these workshops is to provide a 
      forum for the exchange of ideas and preliminary results of topics related 
      to SOSP in an interactive environment. We invite proposals for “open” 
      workshops with the intent to draw upon the collective experience, 
      interests, and opinions of all SOSP attendees.
