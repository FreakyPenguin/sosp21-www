      <h4>Driving Directions:</h4>
      <p>
	If you are renting a car and driving from Toronto Pearson International 
	Airport (YYZ) to the Deerhurst Resort, the travel distance is 
	approximately 220 km (137 miles), and will take just over 2 hours, 
	depending on traffic. The first half of the drive is rather uninspiring 
	(i.e., fast multi-lane freeways), while the second half is quite scenic 
	along smaller highways that lead you into the Muskoka region, which 
	features the forests, lakes, and rocks of the Canadian Shield. There 
	are a few small cities and towns at which to stop for gas, food, 
	coffee, or snacks along the way, but not a lot, so please keep this in 
	mind depending on your fatigue, hunger, and gas tank level.
      </p>
      <p>
	Below are some human-oriented driving directions, but please feel free 
	to rely on Google Maps or your favorite GPS navigation system to help 
	get you there.
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	From YYZ airport, first find the 401 eastbound toward the city of 
	Toronto, and then watch for the 400 northbound, which you will reach 
	within 5-10 km. Note that the exit to the 400 northbound is accessible 
	both from the right hand lane of the 401 itself, as well as from the 
	"collector lanes" to the right of the 401, so don't panic here. Either 
	way is fine.
	</li>
	<li>
	Follow the 400 north about 80 km to Barrie, after which the 400 
	branches into Highway 11 north along Lake Simcoe toward North Bay.
	</li>
	<li>
	Follow Highway 11, which will take you past Orillia (36 km), 
	Bracebridge (55 km more), and into Huntsville (37 km more).
	</li>
	<li>
	Keep going all the way through Huntsville. If you see a Walmart on your 
	right, you are going the correct way, and are getting close to 
	Deerhurst.
	</li>
	<li>
	Watch for Highway 60 towards Ottawa, and take this road for about 6 km. 
	The turnoff to Deerhurst Resort is on the right, and is well marked.  A 
	small and twisty paved road will lead you to the main parking lot.  
	Park in any available spot, and walk to the front desk for hotel 
	check-in, or to the attached conference centre for SOSP check-in. You 
	can move your car later once you know where your specific accommodation 
	is.  You made it.  Welcome!
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	Deerhurst is an all-inclusive resort, with everything you need 
	available on site. There are several restaurant options for food (i.e., 
	Eclipse, Maple, Compass, Antler), lots of recreation options (e.g., 
	swimming, tennis, golf, hiking, climbing, canoes), and good Wireless 
	Internet coverage throughout the property. The landscape should be 
	especially beautiful in October as the leaves on the trees start to 
	change colour.  Enjoy!
