<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
Computer systems are increasingly heterogeneous. Beside classic
heterogeneity, CPUs of different instruction set architectures
(ISAs) are more and more being integrated on the same platform,
including SoC, single machine, data-center, and at the edge.
</p>

<p>
A programmer facing such platforms is challenged by the fact that
each ISA-different processor runs its own software stack (i.e., OS,
compiler, libraries). Although being part of the same system, each
ISAdifferent processor ends up acting like an independent system.
A fundamental limitation of current software is that applications
started on one software stack cannot be migrated to another due to
the ISA difference, limiting resource management, which negatively
affects system-level properties such as performance and energy
consumption.
</p>

<p>
The Popcorn Linux family of projects attacks this problem by enabling
users to exploit platforms of heterogeneous-ISA CPUs. Popcorn Linux
provides the familiar abstraction of a shared memory multiprocessor,
enabling thread-level, process-level, and VM-level migration across
ISA-different processors. This is achieved by a new compiler
toolchain, runtime, OS, and VMM, which taken together, enable
applications to execute on heterogeneous-ISA hardware with minimal
modifications.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial introduces Popcorn Linux OS and Compiler Framework,
shows how to compile and run an application, and discusses execution
migration in a heterogeneous-ISA environment.

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
Formal verification has become an increasingly hot topic in systems
research over recent years due to its promise to guarantee the
absence of classes of bugs. However, formal verification poses a
steep learning curve for systems researchers and practitioners and
often requires a background in formal methods, which hinders a wider
use of verification in our community.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial will introduce Serval (SOSP 2019), a framework for
automated verification of lowlevel systems code that leverages
recent advances to lower the proof burden and minimize developer
effort. For example, using Servalwe have found more than 20 bugs
in systems such as security monitors and the Linux kernel's BPF
subsystem, all confirmed and fixed. This tutorial will give a brief
overview of systems verification in general, a hands-on guide of
how to formally specify and verify a system using Serval, and an
in-depth discussion of formal verification techniques that power
Serval.

<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
Cloud computing services often replicate data, and consistency can matter too 
(particularly for IoT applications, where rapidly-changing data is used to 
coordinate distributed actions).  This tutorial centers on Derecho, a library 
to assist with solving these problems [1, 2].  Derecho is far faster than prior 
solutions, including the weakly-consistent mechanisms that dominate today’s 
cloud computing infrastructures.
</p>

<p>
Derecho’s asynchronous design is key to its performance: the system achieves 
lock-free data streaming for critical paths (queries and updates occur 
concurrently but independently), and data movement is out-of-band from the 
control plane.  The biggest payoff is with RDMA, but Derecho outperforms even 
on TCP.
</p>

<p>
Part of our goal in the tutorial is to understand the “design pattern” that 
enables this big performance boost; it involves separating the control and data 
planes, performing updates on a code path distinct from that used for queries, 
and transforming the system to use an asynchronous streaming communication 
model, in which participants often can independently deduce safety properties 
and perform batches of actions on received data. On 100Gbps RDMA, Derecho can 
send millions of events per second in each subgroup or shard, and throughput 
peaks at almost 16GB/s (125Gbps).
</p>

<p>
We anticipate a few use cases for the technology.  The big one is the Edge IoT: 
Derecho was motivated by the desire to move machine learning tools closer to 
the IoT edge (the first tier of the cloud, which interacts directly with IoT 
devices).  Existing edge platforms lack support for building complex, 
structured applications that maintain state and offer coordinated, consistent 
behavior; Derecho respond to this need.  This said, we also see important 
opportunities in the operating system itself (existing systems have many 
services that could be improved using Derecho.  Some low-hanging fruit includes 
Zookeeper, pub/sub and DDS technologies, file systems like HDFS or Ceph, and 
the network infrastructure layer.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial is structured into two parts.  In the first half, based primarily 
on our TOCS paper [1], situates Derecho relative to prior work, explains how it 
obtains such high speeds, and reviews experiments that clarify why it 
outperforms prior solutions.  We also learn about features aimed at Edge IoT 
applications that work with real-time sensor data yet still need strong 
consistency.  The second part teaches attendees to use Derecho: we walk through 
the process of downloading the library, building services that use it, running 
them locally, and installing them on a cloud.   At the end of the second part, 
participants modify the Derecho demo (a simple AI Sys application), rebuild it 
and rerun it.
</p>

<p>
SOSP participants who only want to hear about the work but not to really learn 
the system are welcome to drop in just at the beginning, and then can duck out 
when we get to the hands-on stage.
