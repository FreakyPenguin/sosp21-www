      <h3>Getting to Deerhurt Resort:</h3>
      <p>
	You have several ground transportation options to get from Toronto 
	Pearson International Airport (YYZ) to the Deerhurst Resort. These 
	include the following:
      </p>
      <h4>Rental Car</h4>
      <p>
	All major car rental companies are available at YYZ. Rates are 
	typically around $40 CAN per day plus taxes and fees, or about $200 CAN 
	per week. Make sure you have good driving directions to get to 
	Deerhurst, or use GPS. Plan to arrive in daylight hours to fully enjoy 
	the two-hour drive (220 km). Depending on your vehicle type, you may 
	need the entire tank of gas to get to Deerhurst and back, so bear this 
	in mind when considering your re-fueling options.
      </p>
      <h4>Taxi</h4>
      <p>
	There are plenty of taxis available in the queue at YYZ, but this might 
	be a relatively expensive option ($120-$300 CAN). If you are sharing a 
	taxi with others, or are on a very tight travel schedule, then this 
	option might make sense for you, but in general it is very pricy. Ride 
	sharing services such as Uber or Lyft might save you a bit on the fare, 
	but are still quite expensive compared to the other options listed.
      </p>
      <h4>Bus</h4>
      <p>
	There are several transportation companies that serve the Muskoka 
	region (e.g., Luxury Coach, Hammond Transportation). You can check 
	their Web sites for pricing, schedules, and the designated pickup 
	location at YYZ. Typical fares with these companies are about $120 CAN 
	for a one-way trip from YYZ to Deerhurst, or about $200 CAN for a 
	round-trip ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
	The conference organizers are currently exploring the option of 
  arranging conference shuttle buses for the arrival days (Saturday and Sunday) 
  and departure day (Wednesday and Thursday). We would provide several buses 
  each day, with up to 50 people on each bus, and a subsidized ticket price of 
  about $75 CAN for a round-trip fare. Stay tuned for further information on 
  this possible option.
      </p>
      <h4>Ride Sharing</h4>
      <p>
	Another option is for conference attendees to use social media to 
	coordinate ride sharing amongst themselves. The conference organizers 
	are considering providing a Web page to help support ride coordination.  
	Stay tuned for further information here if this option happens.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h3>Driving Directions:</h3>
      <p>
	If you are renting a car and driving from Toronto Pearson International 
	Airport (YYZ) to the Deerhurst Resort, the travel distance is 
	approximately 220 km (137 miles), and will take just over 2 hours, 
	depending on traffic. The first half of the drive is rather uninspiring 
	(i.e., fast multi-lane freeways), while the second half is quite scenic 
	along smaller highways that lead you into the Muskoka region, which 
	features the forests, lakes, and rocks of the Canadian Shield. There 
	are a few small cities and towns at which to stop for gas, food, 
	coffee, or snacks along the way, but not a lot, so please keep this in 
	mind depending on your fatigue, hunger, and gas tank level.
      </p>
      <p>
	Below are some human-oriented driving directions, but please feel free 
	to rely on Google Maps or your favorite GPS navigation system to help 
	get you there.
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	From YYZ airport, first find the 401 eastbound toward the city of 
	Toronto, and then watch for the 400 northbound, which you will reach 
	within 5-10 km. Note that the exit to the 400 northbound is accessible 
	both from the right hand lane of the 401 itself, as well as from the 
	"collector lanes" to the right of the 401, so don't panic here. Either 
	way is fine.
	</li>
	<li>
	Follow the 400 north about 80 km to Barrie, after which the 400 
	branches into Highway 11 north along Lake Simcoe toward North Bay.
	</li>
	<li>
	Follow Highway 11, which will take you past Orillia (36 km), 
	Bracebridge (55 km more), and into Huntsville (37 km more).
	</li>
	<li>
	Keep going all the way through Huntsville. If you see a Walmart on your 
	right, you are going the correct way, and are getting close to 
	Deerhurst.
	</li>
	<li>
	Watch for Highway 60 towards Ottawa, and take this road for about 6 km. 
	The turnoff to Deerhurst Resort is on the right, and is well marked.  A 
	small and twisty paved road will lead you to the main parking lot.  
	Park in any available spot, and walk to the front desk for hotel 
	check-in, or to the attached conference centre for SOSP check-in. You 
	can move your car later once you know where your specific accommodation 
	is.  You made it.  Welcome!
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	Deerhurst is an all-inclusive resort, with everything you need 
	available on site. There are several restaurant options for food (i.e., 
	Eclipse, Maple, Compass, Antler), lots of recreation options (e.g., 
	swimming, tennis, golf, hiking, climbing, canoes), and good Wireless 
	Internet coverage throughout the property. The landscape should be 
	especially beautiful in October as the leaves on the trees start to 
	change colour.  Enjoy!

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h3>Accommodation Options</h3>

	<p>
There is a wide variety of accommodation options available
to SOSP attendees staying at the Deerhurst Resort.
These options offer a lot of flexibility in type of
accommodation, location, pricing, and amenities.
Your choice may vary depending on your budget, as well
as whether you are traveling on your own, with your
research group, or with your spouse and/or family.
	</p>

	<p>
Below is a brief overview of each type. Please make sure to
indicate your choice when making your reservation at
the Deerhurst Resort. Also make sure to reserve early,
since there are limited quantities of each room type.
The link for online booking will be provided here in April 2019.
	</p>

	<h4>1. Bayshore (64 units)</h4>

	<p>
This is one of the older buildings at Deerhurst,
offering hotel-style accommodations on the lakefront.
Every room has a water view, and two beds.
This is the most economical option for graduate students,
especially if the room is shared by two people.
The price is $155 CAN per night, plus resort fees and taxes.
The walking time to the conference sessions
will be 8-10 minutes (uphill in the morning, downhill
in the evening).
	</p>

	<h4>2. Pavilion (94 units)</h4>

	<p>
These are hotel-style rooms in the main four-storey building
at Deerhurst, and directly attached to the conference centre,
with minimal travel time back and forth to conference sessions,
and no need to go outdoors.
The rooms are slightly larger than Bayshore, but typically
have just one bed (queen or king). 
These are very nice accommodations, with most having a forest view.
The price is $155 CAN per night, plus resort fees and taxes.
	</p>

  <h4>3. Summit Lodge (~92 units)</h4>

	<p>
These are condo-style units, with sleeping area, bathrooms,
living room, and kitchenettes (i.e., fridge, stove, sink, plates,
cutlery). Most have walkout balconies, typically with a table
and chairs for outdoor patio dining.
The one-bedroom suites have either 2 twin beds or 1 king bed,
and are priced at $175 CAN per night, plus resort fees and taxes,
The two-bedroom units
are priced at $250 CAN per night, plus resort fees and taxes.
The three-bedroom units
are priced at $375 CAN per night, plus resort fees and taxes.
Most of these have a pullout couch/sofa that can be used as an extra bed.
These units are a great option for a research group of 4-8 people,
at a very economical price.
They are about a 5-minute walk from the main conference sessions.
The building also has a "common area" lounge for impromptu meetups or 
discussions.
	</p>

  <h4>4. Condos (~51 units)</h4>

	<p>
There are numerous condominium (condo) units scattered around
the Deerhurst property, either near the lake or the golf course.
These are privately-owned condos that are sub-leased 
for part of the year as Deerhurst rental units.
Some have 2 bedrooms ($250 CAN per night plus resort fees and taxes),
and some have 3 bedrooms ($375 CAN per night plus resort fees and taxes).
Each bedroom has its own ensuite bathroom. There is a full kitchen,
plus a walkout balcony on each unit.
These are very nice accommodations, which are a great option
for a research group to share. Outdoor pool nearby.
The walking time to the conference sessions is 5-10 minutes.
	</p>

  <h4>5. Lakeside Lodge (93 units)</h4>

	<p>
This is the newest building at Deerhurst, which will be
opening for accommodation starting in Fall 2018.
These are condo-style accommodations, next to Bayshore,
and about 8-10 minutes walk from the main conference sessions.
There are studio units, as well as one-bedroom and two-bedroom units.
Pricing is yet to be determined, but will likely be near
$200 CAN per night plus resort fees and taxes.
	</p>

	<h4>Resort Fee</h4>

	<p>
All accommodations at Deerhurst Resort are subject to a
resort fee of 8% on each guestroom, to be paid by conference
attendees as part of their hotell bill. While this may seem
excessive at first glance, it is actually a really good deal.
The resort fee covers parking, WiFi in guest rooms and meeting rooms,
and use of the Deerhurst recreation facilities
(e.g., swimming pools, fitness centre, climbing wall,
beach, lake, canoes, hiking trails, tennis courts, volleyball court,
putting green, firepits, Muskoka chairs).
Golf green fees are extra, as are any motorized vehicle (ATV) rentals.
In short, make sure to enjoy your time at Deerhurst, while 
not missing too many conference sessions!
	</p>

  <h4>Taxes</h4>

  <p>
All accommodations at Deerhurst Resort are subject to Huntsville's
Municipal Accommodation Tax (4%), plus the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)
of 13%, which combines together Ontario's Provincial Sales Tax (PST)
of 8% and Canada's federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 5%.
Visitors to Canada may be eligible to apply for a GST rebate upon
departure from Canada, using the forms provided at the airport.
  </p>

  <h4>Deposit</h4>

  <p>
  Deerhurst Resort requires a deposit equal to the first night's stay,
payable at the time of booking. The balance is due upon checkout
from the Deerhurst Resort following the completion of your stay.
  </p>

  <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>

  <p>
Any cancellations or changes to a booking must be made at least
72 hours prior to your scheduled arrival at Deerhurst.
